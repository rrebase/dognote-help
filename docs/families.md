**DogNote** uses a family system to organize dogs into groups.
Only one family can be active at one time.
A user can belong to multiple families.

Currently, there are two types of roles. The user who created the family
will have administrative rights and the rest will be regular members.

:::note
Only the family administrator can delete a family.

### Create a family

Creating a family is simple. After logging in you'll see a **Create Family** button.
Press that to start the family creation process. If you're already in a family,
go to `Settings -> Family -> Change Family` and navigate back to the family selection screen.

### Invite a member

Family members can invite new members in two ways.
First, navigate to `Settings -> Family` and then you'll have two options:

1. The person isn't using DogNote yet. Send the magic **invite link** to the person. This can then be used to join the family after downloading the app.
2. The person is already a DogNote user. **Search by name** and you will be able to send an invite.
That person will then be able to accept the invite to join the family.

### Join a family

Joining a family can happen in two ways. You can either **receive an invite** directly if you're
already a DogNote user. Otherwise, a unique **invite code** can also be used to join a family.

### Remove a member

The family administrator has the right to remove a member.
This can be done by clicking the **Edit icon** next to a member and then pressing **Remove from family**.
